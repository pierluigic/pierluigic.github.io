I am researcher at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics, and Theory of Science (FLoV) at the University of Gothenburg. He is part of the RJ-funded 6-year research program [“Change is Key!”](https://www.changeiskey.org/), which develops cutting-edge computational methods to detect language change, with the aim of advancing the study of both contemporary and historical societies.

My research focuses on computational modeling of lexical semantics, particularly in the area of distributional semantics. I am specialized in the development and application of state-of-the-art computational models for the detection of lexical semantic change. I have contributed to the creation of widely used benchmarks and models that facilitate robust evaluation in the Lexical Semantic Change Detection area, which are now being adopted by the wider research community.
